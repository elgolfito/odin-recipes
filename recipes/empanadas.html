    <!-- description of the food in the next paragraph -->
    <p>There are as many variations of empanadas as there are cooks in Argentina
        (though they’re popular throughout Latin America, and Spain too). This
        version was developed by BA’s former test kitchen manager Gaby Melian,
        who is from Buenos Aires and was taught as a little girl by her mother and
        grandmother how to make them. She prefers these ones baked, not fried—and
        the puff pastry dough ensures you’ll still get all of those flaky layers.
        (If you prefer fried ones, try Gaby’s Ham, Cheese, and Onion Empanadas.)
    </p>
    <p> Empanadas have “saved me so many times,” writes Gaby in her step-by-step guide.
        “Birthday parties? Empanadas. Somebody’s coming over? Empanadas.” Keeping
        some in the freezer certainly helps. These beef empanadas can hang out there
        for three months—just be sure to freeze them on a sheet tray first so they
        don’t stick together.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 lb. ground beef (20% fat)</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 small red bell peppers, seeded, chopped</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp. ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. sweet paprika</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken stock or broth</li>
        <li>2 tsp. sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raisins</li>
        <li>3 packages (12 each) Puff Pastry Dough for Turnovers/Empanadas</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pitted green olives (Picholine or Spanish), rinsed well, cut in half lengthwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot over high. Cook beef, breaking up with a spoon, 
            until browned but not completely cooked through, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a
             medium bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving as much fat in pan as possible.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and cook onion, bell peppers, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, 
            stirring, until tender but not browned, 6–8 minutes; season with salt and black 
            pepper. Add cumin, paprika, oregano, and cayenne and cook, stirring, until 
            fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken stock and reserved beef along with any 
            accumulated juices to pot. Stir in sugar, 4 tsp. salt, and ¼ tsp. black pepper. 
            Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring and scraping up any brown bits, until most 
            of the liquid is evaporated, 15–20 minutes; taste and season with salt and black 
            pepper, if needed. Stir in raisins. Transfer to a medium bowl, cover, and chill 
            at least 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Let dough sit at room temperature 15 minutes to temper. 
            Remove 6 rounds from package, keeping plastic divider underneath, and arrange on 
            a work surface. Place 2 Tbsp. filling in the center of each round. Top with 2 
            olive halves. Brush water around half of outer edge of each round. Using plastic 
            divider to help you, fold round over filling and pinch edges to seal. Using a fork, 
            crimp edges. Remove plastic and transfer empanada to a parchment-lined sheet tray, 
            spacing 1" apart. Repeat with remaining rounds (you’ll get about 12 empanadas on 
            each tray).</li>
        <li>Bake empanadas, rotating tray halfway through, until golden brown and slightly 
            darker around the edges, 25–35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Do Ahead: Filling can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled. Unbaked empanadas can 
            be made 3 months ahead; freeze on sheet tray, then transfer to freezer bags and 
            keep frozen.</li>
    </ol>
